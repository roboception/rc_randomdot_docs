Installation

Warning: The instructions on

  Safety

   related to the

  rc_randomdot

   and

  rc_visard

   must be read and understood prior to installation.

Mounting

The

rc_randomdot

 offers a mounting-point setup with standard tripod thread at the
bottom, and pivot points for the provided mounting bracket on either
side.


For troubleshooting purposes, the projector may be mounted using the
standardized tripod thread (UNC 1/4"-20) at the bottom of the housing.
For mounting the

rc_randomdot

 on top of an

rc_visard

 in static or low dynamic applications (e.g. above robot cells or on
mobile platforms), the supplied mounting bracket must be attached to
the

rc_visard

 with two M4 x 10 8.8 machine screws, and the projector must be
attached to the mounting bracket with two M4 x 10 8.8 machine screws
at the pivot points. All screws must be tightened to 2.4 Nm and only
TufLok nylon coated screws may be used. Alternatively screws need to
be secured with a medium-strength threadlocking adhesive such as
Loctite 243. Maximum thread depth is 6 mm. The supplied mounting
bracket is not suitable for dynamic robot applications. It is the
customer's responsibility to provide adequate mounting of the

rc_randomdot

.

Warning: For permanent installations, the

  rc_randomdot

   must be mounted with four M4 x 10 8.8 machine screws tightened to
  2.4 Nm torque. Screws must be Tuflok coated or secured with
  threadlocking adhesive. Do not use high-strength bolts.

Warning: The supplied mounting bracket is not suitable for dynamic
  robot applications. It is the customer's responsibility to provide
  adequate mounting of the

  rc_randomdot

  .

Depending on the working distance, it might be necessary to tilt the
projector downwards to cover the complete filed of view of the

rc_visard

. This can be accomplished by loosening the screws attaching the

rc_randomdot

 to the mounting bracket at the pivot point, and moving the

rc_randomdot

 to the desired angle.


Power-up

Note: Always fully connect and tighten all M12 connectors on the
  both the

  rc_visard

   and

  rc_randomdot


  before

   turning on the power supply.

After connecting the system to power, the LEDs on the front of the

rc_randomdot

 and

rc_visard

 should immediately illuminate. During the

rc_visard

's boot process, it's LED will change color and will eventually turn
green. This signals that all processes are up and running. The

rc_randomdot

's status LED should turn green right away. The

rc_randomdot

 projector will flash a number of times during the boot process.

Warning: Do not look into the lens of the

  rc_randomdot

   or into the light beam at any point during startup or operation.

For troubleshooting the

rc_visard

's boot process and connections, please refer to the

rc_visard

 documentation at

https://doc.rc-visard.com/latest/en/troubleshooting.html#led-colors

.

Operating the projector

The

rc_randomdot

 projector is controlled via the GPIO Out 1 of the

rc_visard

. For a tutorial on operating the projector, please refer to:

https://tutorials.roboception.de/rc_visard_general/projector.html

.

Note: A valid IOControl license is required on the

  rc_visard

  . It is included in the standard on-board software package of all
  rc_visards purchased 07/2020 and thereafter. For upgrading an older

  rc_visard

  , please obtain your license at

  https://roboception.com/product/rc_reason-iocontrol

  .

State and behaviour of the

rc_visard

's GPIOs can then be controlled via the

rc_visard

's WebGUI IOControl panel from the Modules tab. Starting with

rc_visard

 firmware 20.10, GPIO Out 1 is set to

Low

 by default, turning the projector off.

ExposureActive

 turns on the

rc_randomdot

 for exactly the exposure time of every image.

High

 will turn the projector on continuosly, but reduce power to 18% to
protect the light source.

Typically, the user will select

ExposureAlternateActive

 mode, in which the

rc_randomdot

 is on only for the exposure time of every second image. Images with
projected pattern are used for computing depth images. Images without
pattern can be used for texture or other image processing modules.

In

ExposureAlternateActive

 mode, the

rc_visard

's auto exposure algorithm ensures that images with pattern are
correctly exposed in order to produce dense disparity images. As
identical exposure settings are used for the images without pattern,
which are displayed in the WebGUI, those might be underexposed
depending on overall illumination conditions. This effect can be
minimized by properly adjusting environmental light conditions,
projector lens aperture, and exposure time.

Adjusting focus and aperture settings

Remove the

rc_randomdot

's protective lens cap by unscrewing it. To change focus and aperture
settings, loosen the three small Phillips screws on the respective
lens ring, turn the ring to the desired setting and lightly tighten
the screws again.

For the location of the focus and aperture rings, please refer to

Fig. 11

.


For focus adjustments, the projector should be turned on permanently
by setting the

rc_visard

's GPIO Out 1 mode to High in the WebGUI. For aperture adjustments,
GPIO Out 1 should be set to

ExposureAlternateActive

 and exposure mode should be set to

Auto

 in the WebGUI Camera tab. Please refer to

https://tutorials.roboception.de/rc_visard_general/projector.html

 for a tutorial on how to obtain dense depth images.

Starting from the largest aperture (smallest f-stop number on
projector lens), reduce light output by decreasing the aperture until
the white (high confidence) areas in the confidence image start to get
smaller or darker. At the same time, the camera image should become
less underexposed.

At this point, slightly open the aperture again to find a suitable
compromise. Retighten the small Phillips screws on the focus and
aperture rings to lock them in place and replace the protective lens
cap to restore the IP54 rating and EMC compatibility of the projector.
