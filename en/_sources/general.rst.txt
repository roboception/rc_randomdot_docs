Overview

The dot-matrix projector

rc_randomdot

 is specifically tailored to be used with an

rc_visard

. The

rc_randomdot

 is utilized when the perception of particularly difficult scenes with
little or no natural texture is required. It can be mounted over a
scene or directly on any

rc_visard

. By projecting a semirandom dot pattern, it increases the scene
density and hence improves the quality of stereo matching when the
natural scene texture is low.


The terms "projector", "

rc_randomdot


White

", and "

rc_randomdot

" used throughout the manual all refer to the Effilux

rc_randomdot

 family of semirandom dot projectors with rectangular housing.
Installation and control for all projectors are exactly the same, and
all use the same mounting base.

Note: This manual uses the metric system and mostly uses the units
  meter and millimeter. Unless otherwise specified, all dimensions in
  technical drawings are in millimeters.
