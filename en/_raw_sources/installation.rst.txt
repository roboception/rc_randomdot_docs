.. Warning:: The instructions on :ref:`sect-safety`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{safety:sect-safety})`
  related to the |rc_randomdot| and |rc_visard| must be read and understood prior to installation.


Mounting
--------

.. index::
   single: mounting

The |rd| offers a mounting-point setup with standard
tripod thread at the bottom, and pivot points for the provided mounting bracket on either side.

.. The |rd| *White* and |rd| *IR* offer identical mounting-point setups  with a standard
.. tripod thread at the bottom, and pivot points for the provided mounting bracket on either side.

   Mounting bracket for connecting the |rd| to the |rc_visard|

For troubleshooting purposes, the projector may be mounted using the standardized tripod
thread (UNC 1/4"-20) at the bottom of the housing. For mounting the |rd| on top of an |rc_visard|
in static or low dynamic applications (e.g. above robot cells or on mobile platforms),
the supplied mounting bracket must be attached to the |rc_visard|
with two M4 x 10 8.8 machine screws, and the projector must be attached to the mounting bracket
with two M4 x 10 8.8 machine screws at the pivot points. All screws must be tightened
to 2.4 Nm and only TufLok nylon coated screws may be used. Alternatively screws need to be secured
with a medium-strength threadlocking adhesive such as Loctite 243. Maximum thread depth is 6 mm.
The supplied mounting bracket is not suitable for dynamic robot applications.
It is the customer's responsibility to provide adequate mounting of the |rd|.

.. Warning:: For permanent installations, the |rc_randomdot| must be mounted with four M4 x 10 8.8 machine screws
  tightened to 2.4 Nm torque. Screws must be Tuflok coated or secured with threadlocking adhesive. Do not use high-strength bolts.

.. Warning:: The supplied mounting bracket is not suitable for dynamic robot applications.
  It is the customer's responsibility to provide adequate mounting of the |rd|.

Depending on the working distance, it might be necessary to tilt the projector
downwards to cover the complete filed of view of the |rc_visard|. This can be accomplished by loosening the
screws attaching the |rd| to the mounting bracket at the pivot point, and moving the |rd| to the desired angle.

Power-up
--------

.. index::
  single: power-up

.. Note:: Always fully connect and tighten all M12 connectors on the both the |rc_visard| and |rc_randomdot|
  *before* turning on the power supply.

After connecting the system to power, the LEDs on the front of the |rc_randomdot| and |rc_visard| should
immediately illuminate. During the |rc_visard|'s boot process, it's LED will change
color and will eventually turn green. This signals that all processes are up and
running. The |rd|'s status LED should turn green right away. The |rd| projector will flash
a number of times during the boot process.

.. Warning:: Do not look into the lens of the |rd| or into the light beam at any point during startup or operation.

For troubleshooting the |rc_visard|'s boot process and connections, please refer to the |rc_visard| documentation at
https://doc.rc-visard.com/latest/en/troubleshooting.html#led-colors.

The |rc_randomdot| projector is controlled via the GPIO Out 1 of the |rc_visard|.

   For a tutorial on operating the projector, please refer to: https://tutorials.roboception.de/rc_visard_general/projector.html.

   .. Note:: A valid IOControl license is required on the |rc_visard|. It is included in the standard on-board software
      package of all rc_visards purchased 07/2020 and thereafter. For upgrading an older |rc_visard|, please obtain
      your license at https://roboception.com/product/rc_reason-iocontrol.

      WebGUI IOControl tab

State and behavior of the |rc_visard|'s GPIOs can then be controlled via the |rc_visard|'s WebGUI
IOControl panel from the Modules tab. Starting with |rc_visard| firmware 20.10, GPIO Out 1 is set to *Low* by default,
turning the projector off.
*ExposureActive* turns on the |rc_randomdot| for exactly the exposure time of every image.
*High* will turn the projector on continuously, but reduce power to 18% to protect the light source.

Typically, the user will select *ExposureAlternateActive* mode, in which the |rc_randomdot| is on only for the exposure
time of every second image. Images with projected pattern are used for computing depth images. Images
without pattern can be used for texture or other image processing modules.

In *ExposureAlternateActive* mode, the |rc_visard|'s auto exposure algorithm ensures that images with pattern
are correctly exposed in order to produce dense disparity images. As identical exposure settings are used for
the images without pattern, which are displayed in the WebGUI, those might be underexposed depending on
overall illumination conditions. This effect can be minimized by properly adjusting environmental light
conditions, projector lens aperture, and exposure time.

Adjusting focus
---------------

.. index::
  single: focus

During production, the focus of the |rd| is set to a distance 1.2Â m by default. When the 
projector is used for a very different working distance, adapting the focus might be necessary.
Perfectly focusing the projector is not crucial. A slightly blurred projection pattern will not degrade the depth image.

To inspect the sharpness of the projector pattern, the projector should be turned on permanently
by setting the *Out1 / Projector* mode to ``High`` on the |webgui| under 
:menuselection:`Camera --> IOControl Settings` or :menuselection:`Configuration --> IOControl`. 

The projector focus only needs to be adjusted when the projector pattern is strongly blurred.
In this case, remove the |rd|'s protective lens cap by unscrewing it. Then loosen the three small
fixing Phillips screws on the focus ring as shown in :numref:`fig-000-focus`.
Then, turn the focus ring until the visible projector pattern becomes sharp. 
After that, lightly tighten the focus ring screws again and replace the protective lens cap to restore the IP54 rating 
and EMC compatibility of the projector.

Adjusting aperture
------------------

.. index::
  single: aperture

The aperture of the |rd| influences the brightness of the projector pattern. By default,
the aperture of the |rd| is fully open, which means the projector has maximum brightness.
The aperture should be adjusted so that the brightness difference between images taken
with projector and images taken without projector is not too large, but the projector pattern is 
still visible in the images taken with projector. To find the correct setting, make sure the external
light in the working environment is similar to what is expected during productive mode and the 
camera with the |rd| is mounted at the desired distance from the scene.

Then, on the |webgui| under :menuselection:`Camera`, set the 
*Exposure* mode to ``Auto`` and set the *Auto Exposure Mode* to ``AdaptiveOut1``.
Also set the *Out1 / Projector* mode to ``ExposureAlternateActive`` under *IOControl Settings*,
so that every second image is taken with projector pattern.
Now, the text line under the live images shows the *Out1 reduction* value in percent.

The *Out1 reduction* value describes the reduction of the brightness of the image without projection compared to the 
image with projection. The value should be between 10% and 20%. A higher *Out1 reduction* value means, that the projector is
too bright compared to the external lighting, which leads to images without projector patterns being too dark.
Thus, external lighting should be increased, e.g. by installing an additional
light source, or the brightness of the projector should be reduced by slightly closing the aperture. In analogy, if the 
*Out1 reduction* value is too low, the projector is not bright enough compared to the external light,
which means that the projector pattern will hardly be visible in the camera images and cannot enhance the depth computation.
So the external light should be reduced or the projector brightness must be increased by opening the aperture.

The aperture of the projector can be adjusted by removing the |rd|'s protective lens cap by unscrewing it. Then loosen
the three small fixing Phillips screws on the aperture ring as shown in :numref:`fig-000-focus`.
Now turn the ring until the *Out1 reduction* value is in the range between 10% and 20%. 

After that, the darkest object that is possible in the application should be placed in the field of view of the camera.
If the dark object is not properly visible in the depth image, then the projector brightness must be increased, 
despite high *Out1 reduction* values.

In the end, lightly tighten the aperture ring screws again and replace the protective lens cap to restore the IP54 rating 
and EMC compatibility of the projector.
