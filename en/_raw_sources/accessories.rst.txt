.. only:: roboception

  |company| offers an optional connectivity kit to aid customers with setting up the |rc_visard| and |rd|.
  The connectivity kit consists of a:

  - network cable with straight M12 plug to straight RJ45 connector in either 2 m, 5 m, or 10 m length,
  - power adapter cable with straight M12 socket to DC barrel connector in 30 cm length,
  - 24 V, 60 W desktop power supply.

For permanent installation, the customer is responsible for providing a suitable power supply.

Connecting the |rc_visard| and |rc_randomdot| to residential or office grid power requires a power
supply that meets EN 55011 Class B emission standards and/or EN 55032 Class B emission standards.
The power supply contained in the connectivity kit is certified accordingly. However, it does not meet
immunity standards for industrial environments under EN 61000-6-2.

Wiring
------

Only a short cable to connect power and GPIOs between |rc_visard| and |rc_randomdot|
is supplied as standard equipment with the |rc_randomdot|. It can be used for permanently connecting
an |rc_visard| to an |rd| mounted on top of it.
It is the customer's responsibility to obtain appropriate parts for all other scenarios. The following
sections provide an overview of suggested components.

Power connections

   single: power cable

The |rc_randomdot| contains an 8-pin A-coded M12 plug connector for power and GPIO connectivity
to the robot controller. Various cabling solutions can be obtained from third party vendors.
A selection of M12 to open ended cables is provided below. Customers are required to provide
power and GPIO connections to the cables according to the pinouts described
in :ref:`sect-wiring`:latex:`\:(Section \ref{hardware_spec:sect-wiring})`. Both
the |rc_visard|'s and |rc_randomdot|'s housing must be connected to ground.

Power supplies
""""""""""""""

.. index::
   single: power supply

The |rc_visard| and |rc_randomdot| are classified as EN-55011 Class B devices and are
immune to light industrial and industrial environments. For connecting the sensor
to residential grid power, a power supply under EN 55011/55022 Class B has to be used.

It is the customer's responsibility to obtain and install a suitable power supply
for permanent use in industrial environments.
One example that satisfies both EN 61000-6-2 and EN 55011/55022 Class B is the DIN-Rail
mounted PULS MiniLine ML70.100 24V/DC 3 A by PULS GmbH (http://www.pulspower.com).
A certified electrician must perform installation.

Only one set of |rc_visard| and |rc_randomdot| shall be connected to a power supply
at any time, and the total length of cables must be less than 30 m.
