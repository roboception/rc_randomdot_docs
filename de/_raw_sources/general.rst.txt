Overview
========

The dot-matrix projector |rc_randomdot| is specifically tailored to be used with an
|rc_visard|. The |rc_randomdot| is utilized when the perception of particularly difficult scenes with little or
no natural texture is required. It can be mounted over a scene or directly on any
|rc_visard|. By projecting a semirandom dot pattern, it increases the scene density and hence improves the quality of
stereo matching when the natural scene texture is low.

.. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this guide applies to both the *White* and the *IR* version of the |rc_randomdot| projector.

The terms "projector", "|rc_randomdot| *White*", and "|rc_randomdot|" used throughout the manual
all refer to the |manufacturer| |rc_randomdot|
family of semirandom dot projectors with rectangular housing.
Installation and control for all projectors are exactly the same, and all use the same mounting base.
