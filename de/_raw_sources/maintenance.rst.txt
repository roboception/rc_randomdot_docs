.. Warning:: The only part removable by the customer is the lens cap, which can be unscrewed.
   The customer does not need to open the |rc_randomdot|'s housing to
   perform maintenance. Unauthorized opening of the housing will void the warranty. For all maintenance
   operations other than adjusting focus and aperture, the product must be switched off.

To handle the optical components, wearing gloves is strongly recommended. The lens
cap can be removed by unscrewing the barrel. Then focus and the aperture can be
adjusted with manual settings of the C-mount lens.

.. Warning:: The lens cap needs to be in place during normal operation to meet EMC requirements.

  single: lens cleaning

Glass lenses with antireflective coating are used to reduce glare. Please take special
care when cleaning the lenses. To clean them, use a compressed air duster or soft lens-cleaning brush to remove
dust or dirt particles. To remove stubborn dirt, wipe 1-2 drops of a non-alcohol-based lens cleaning
solution formulated for coated lenses (such as the Uvex Clear family of products) in a gentle circular motion with a cleaning tissue.
Always apply the fluid to a tissue rather than the lens itself.
